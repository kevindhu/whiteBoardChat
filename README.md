A very light web application that implements web socket API. A lot of this code was pulled from outside resources, including:

- https://netbeans.org/kb/docs/javaee/maven-websocketapi.html

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjUbKcEcLQA

This is simply a demo I wanted to make for me to better understand how to work with java websockets and Java EE in general.
